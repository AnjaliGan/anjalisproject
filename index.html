        <h2>By Anjali Ganguly</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Anjali Ganuguly, and I'm in 5th grade! I live with my mom and dad and little brother named Arjun and my <br>
            pet dog Otto, who is a shih-poo. My hobbies are reading, playing Roblox, and playing tennis. I also like drawing. <br>
             My favorite subject is Science because I like learning about Outer Space. My favorite color is teel.</p>
